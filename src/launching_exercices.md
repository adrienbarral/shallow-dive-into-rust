# Exercices

Exercices must be checked out from the github repo XXXXXX.

**Do not try to compile this repository, exercices will consists in making the exercices compiling !**

Each exercices is a unit test. To run a specific unit test (to solve an exercice), you can either run the cargo command : 
```
cargo test <test name>
```

Or by pressing the run test button in vscode (if the rust extension is properly installed and configured) as shown in the figure bellow.
