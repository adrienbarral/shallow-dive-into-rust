# Variables type

All variables are strictly typed, most of the time type is infered.


```
let <variable name>[: <variable type>] = <variable value>
```

Both lines are strictly equivalents : 

```rust
let a: i32 = 8;
```

```rust
let a = 8; // by default integer number is infered as i32
```

**In rust we do an extreme usage of type inference, this why vscode extension that display type are very usefull**

## Scalar types :

### Integers

|rust type|range|name|
|---|---|---|
|i8|-128 &rarr; 127| signed 8 bits integer|
|i16|-32768 &rarr; 32767| signed 16 bits integer|
|i32|-2,147,483,648 &rarr; 2,147,483,647| signed 32 bits integer|
|i64|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 &rarr; 9,223,372,036,854,775,807| signed 64 bits integer|
|isize| depend of the CPU. i32 for a 32Bits CPU, i64 for a 64Bits|pointer size|
|u8|0 &rarr; 255| signed 8 bits integer|
|u16|0 &rarr; 65535| signed 16 bits integer|
|u32|0 &rarr; 4,294,967,295| signed 32 bits integer|
|u64|0 &rarr; 18,446,744,073,709,551,615| signed 64 bits integer|
|usize| depend of the CPU. u32 for a 32Bits CPU, u64 for a 64Bits|pointer size|

### Real numbers : 
|rust type|range|name|
|---|---|---|
|f32|-3.4E38 &rarr; 3.4E38|Single precision floating point|
|f64|-1.7E308 &rarr; 1.7E308|Double precision floating point|

### Characters

In rust a character is coded on 4 bytes and is UTF-8 encoded.
So writing the following line is perfectly correct :

```rust
let smiley: char = 'ðŸ˜€';
let sentence = String::new("I am so happy ! ðŸ˜€");
```
Note that `char` is initialized with simple quotes and string with double quote. In both case, we can use UTF-8 charset.

### Booleans

As in all languages booleans values can be either `true` or `false`

```rust
let t = true; // with type inference
let a: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation.
```

## There is no "implicit cast" like in C/C++

In c++ you can write : 
```
uint32_t foo = 2.1;
```

In rust, you can't. The following line produce an error : 
```rust
let foo: u32 = 2.1;
```

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> ex1/src/main.rs:4:20
  |
4 |     let foo: u32 = 2.1;
  |              ---   ^^^ expected `u32`, found floating-point number
  |              |
  |              expected due to this
```

# Variables mutability

By default in rust, a variable is immutable. The following lines are incorrects :
```rust
let foo = 2;
foo = 3;
```

```
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `foo`
 --> ex1/src/main.rs:5:1
  |
4 |     let foo = 2;
  |         ---
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `foo`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut foo`
5 | foo = 3;
  | ^^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

A variable is mutable if it is defined like this : 

```rust
let mut foo = 2;
foo = 3;
```

# Function

## `return` keyoword is not mendatory


> **Exercice**
> Create a function called `addition` taking into arguments two `u32` and returning sum of this two numbers as a `u32`.
> This must make passing the unit test called `ex1_addition`.
