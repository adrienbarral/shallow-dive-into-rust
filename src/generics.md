# Generics

This feature of the language allow to define behaviour on abstract types that are known implementing a certain trait.
For exemple, a method able to return the min value between two `f32` can be :

```rust
fn min(n: f32, m: f32) -> f32 {
    if n < m {
        n
    } 
    m
}
```

A old C++ developer will write something like that : 

```rust
fn min<T>(n: T, m: T) -> T 
{
    if n < m {
        return n;
    }
    return m;
}

fn main(){
    let m = min(3, 2);
}
```

But this will not compile with the following error message : 
```
error[E0369]: binary operation `<` cannot be applied to type `T`
 --> src/lib.rs:3:10
  |
3 |     if n < m {
  |        - ^ - T
  |        |
  |        T
  |
help: consider restricting type parameter `T`
  |
1 | fn min<T: std::cmp::PartialOrd>(n: T, m: T) -> T 
  |  
  ```
Because rust will compile the generic method, where C++ will wait to have a concrete type to generate a method and compile it. This is a very different approach.

If we need to write this method for all types that are "comparable", that means on which the `<` operator apply, we can write a generic version of this methods like this : 

```rust
fn min<T>(n: T, m: T) -> T 
where T: PartialOrd 
{
    if n < m {
        return n;
    }
    return m;
}
```
This is a method that use the **generic** feature of rust.

# Exercice : 
1. From scratch, create a structure that represent a complex number, and implement the traits Add and ans Sub to be able to use operators + and -.

2. Implements the Default trait for our Complex type. Default value will be 0,0.

3. Create a method called ```Ã¬ntegrate``` that will compute the summ of a type that can be converted into an iterator (implementing the IntoIterator trait), and rturning the integral of this collection. Signature of the method is really hard to find and understand. This is a "bonnus exercice". You can read [this SOF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45764578/what-does-rhs-refer-to-in-a-compiler-error-message-about-partialeq) question (and answear) to help you.
