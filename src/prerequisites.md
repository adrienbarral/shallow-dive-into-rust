# Prerequisties of this course :
* Knowledge of another strongly typed language (C/C++, Java ...)
* Knowledge of basic Object Oriented Programming concepts (Inheritence, polymorphism)
* Already using a Command Line Interface (CLI) like bash, powershell ...
* A computer with the following tools installed and running : 
  * Linux is recommended, and I will be more comfortable to help you on this OS, but it is not required. Rust is portable enough to be run on any common OS.
  * GIT
  * rust installable via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
  * VSCode with following extensions : 
     * rust-analyzer (from rustlang), downloadable [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
     * CodeLLDB to enable debugging of your programs.

# Test your installation : 

In your favorite CLI create a rust package and run it : 

```bash
cargo init hello-world
cd hello-world
cargo run
```

You should see : 
```
