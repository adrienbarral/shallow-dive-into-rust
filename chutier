Warning: The evaluation order of operands swaps depending on the types of the operands:
with primitive types the right-hand side will get evaluated first, while with non-primitive types the left-hand side will get evaluated first.
Try not to write code that depends on the evaluation order of operands in compound assignment expressions.
See [this test] for an example of using this dependency.
